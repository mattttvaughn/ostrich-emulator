<p>A few months ago I came across a great post on Hacker news was titled <a
        href="https://blog.rekawek.eu/2017/02/09/coffee-gb/">"Why did I spend 1.5 months creating a Gameboy
    emulator?"</a> When I first read it, I zero experience with assembly language and the entire post was a distant
    fantasy to meâ€” something which I would love to do but I wouldn't have a clue where to start. After finishing the
    wonderful <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/">Nand2Tetris</a> course online and acquiring some background
    knowledge on how assembly language and memory work, when I stumbled on the same article again I knew I had to make
    an attempt at my own emulator.</p>
<p>I plan to write this series to document my own process creating a GameBoy emulator. I want it to be a document anyone
    can use (myself included) to locate resources on GameBoy hardware and emulator creation.</p>

<p>The blog post that inspired this project for me is a great place to learn about
    the architecture of the GameBoy and get a sense for the basic structure of an
    emulator</p>
<p>I found <a href="http://www.devrs.com/gb/files/opcodes.html">this page</a> to be the most
    useful in explaining the opcodes AND all of the terminology used to explain
    commands (n, nn, r... etc.).</p>
