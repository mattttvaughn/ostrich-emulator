# Making a GameBoy editor

A few months ago I came across a great post on Hacker news was titled ["Why did I spend 1.5 months creating a Gameboy emulator?"](https://blog.rekawek.eu/2017/02/09/coffee-gb/) When I first read it, I zero experience with assembly language and the entire post was a distant fantasy to meâ€” something which I would love to do but I wouldn't have a clue where to start. After finishing the wonderful [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course online and acquiring some background knowledge on how assembly language and memory work, when I stumbled on the same article again I knew I had to make an attempt at my own emulator.

I plan to write this series to document my own process creating a GameBoy emulator. I want it to be a document anyone can use (myself included) to locate resources on GameBoy hardware and emulator creation.

### Overview

The blog post that inspired this project for me is a great place to learn about
the architecture of the GameBoy and get a sense for the basic structure of an
emulator

I found [this page](http://www.devrs.com/gb/files/opcodes.html) to be the most
useful in explaining the opcodes AND all of the terminology used to explain
commands (n, nn, r... etc.).

[Exlanation of push/pop](http://sgate.emt.bme.hu/patai/publications/z80guide/part1.html). Also contains other useful explanations of commands, but I didn't have a need for those.

I used [this](https://realboyemulator.wordpress.com/2013/01/03/a-look-at-the-game-boy-bootstrap-let-the-fun-begin/) to figure out exactly how the JR command works.
